# Scripts and technical documentation for the AIDOS Lab

This repository aims to collect some additional 'technical goodies' for
the AIDOS Lab. In contrast to the Welcome Guide, which primarily
provides a basis for our working culture, this repository is about more
about practical questions: how to set up a good environment on our
compute cluster? How to transfer files?

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/aidos-lab/dotfiles/wiki) for all
content.
